<p>It's a me, Bartol! I'm the guy you call when you need help with Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning or Software Developing.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>After completing the renowned XV. Gymnasium, I
have decided to continue my education on the prestigious Croatian faculty, the
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing also known as under the acronym
<a href="http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en">FER</a>. During my Bachelor years I have learned a lot about programming,
algorithms and computer architectures, became an expert in a few programming
languages, learned to cooperate with others during complex projects,
but one thing I am most proud of is that I have learned to solve
problems in a systematic fashion. This has enabled me to work out any kind of
obstacle I have faced.</p>
<p>After finishing my Bachelors in June 2016, I have decided to pursue my Masters on the same
faculty with Computer Science as my major. My emphasis is on the classes which
are oriented towards machine learning, statistics and data analysis.</p>

<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>My first role as an intern was in the Summer of 2015 at the company called
<a href="http://croz.net/en/">CROZ</a>.
I was working in team with other students on some web
and mobile apps. At the end of the internship I decided to stay there as a part
time software developer. During the Summer of 2016 I managed to secure a
data analyst internship at <a href="http://www.styria.com/en/">Styria</a>.
This opportunity was a big challenge for me because I had no formal education in the data
science field. Nevertheless, I have successfully
completed the internship and gained a lot of new knowledge throughout it.</p>
