<p>It's a me, Bartol! I'm the guy you call when you need help with Machine Learning, 
Deep Learning or Software Developing.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>After completing the renowned XV. Gymnasium, I
have decided to continue my education on the prestigious Croatian faculty, the
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing also known as under the acronym
<a href="http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en">FER</a>. During my Bachelor years I have learned a lot about programming,
algorithms and computer architectures, became an expert in a few programming
languages, learned to cooperate with others during complex projects,
but one thing I am most proud of is that I have learned to solve
problems in a systematic fashion. This has enabled me to work out any kind of
obstacle I have faced.</p>
<p>Finishing my Bachelor's in June 2016 has opened the door to the Master's program
which I have decided to pursue with the Computer Science as my major.
My emphasis is on the classes which
are oriented towards machine learning, statistics and data analysis.</p>

<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>My first role as an intern was in the Summer of 2015 at the company called
<a href="http://croz.net/en/">CROZ</a> where
was working in team with other students on some web
and mobile apps. At the end of the internship I decided to stay there as a part
time software developer. During the Summer of 2016 I managed to secure a
data analyst internship at <a href="http://www.styria.com/en/">Styria</a>.
This opportunity was a big challenge for me because I had no formal education in the data
science field. Nevertheless, I have successfully
completed the internship and gained a lot of new knowledge throughout it.</p>


<h2>Free time</h2>
<p>I'm a very busy and serious man who has no time for fooling around...</p>
<p>... Well, I lied. Of course I have my free time and I try to use it in a best
possible way. Or at least this is how I define "best possible way". This time
is reserved for movies, reading, pointless Web browsing, hanging out with my
friends, gym and every other thing an average student would do in his free time.
<br>And yeah, sometimes I have a moment of inspiration and I start working on a personal
project like this website.</p>
