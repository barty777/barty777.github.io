For my Bachelor thesis I chose to experiment with deep learning and deep
recurrent networks. Focus of my work was on sentiment analysis of user comments
from different domains and languages. This was my first encounter with deep
learning domain and I can say that I have learned a lot while working on this
project.

## Abstract
Deep learning is a relatively new branch of machine learning based on the theory of
neural networks. Using the advanced deep neural network architectures, today’s well
known natural language processing problems like sentiment and opinion mining are
being solved. Two widely used configurations of recurrent neural networks were created
with the Tensorflow software: [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)
and [GRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit). Many different experiments were
conducted in which the focus was on finding the optimal parameters of the recurrent
neural networks, which would yield in correct stance classification of user comments
from the Croatian and English datasets.

This paper was created in collaboration with my mentor
[Jan Šnajder](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~jan/), [Martin Tutek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtutek)
and other colleagues from [TakeLab](http://takelab.fer.hr/).
