[Lektire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lektire.myapp) is an
Android application which offers the user almost all of the book summaries from
the Croatian high schools. I started working on this project while I was a high
school senior and had it finished in two months work. This project was
meant to be an introduction to the world of Android development for me and it turned
out to be more than that. Not only did I create the app, but I had also learned a lot
about general programming concepts (I wasn't much of a programming fan back
then), grasped some basic Java programming, practiced my GUI skills, and learned
how to distribute an Android application.

The most surprising thing about all of this is how popular has the app become.
In just a few days it already had more than 1000 downloads and the number was
increasing day by day. Today it has around 150,000 downloads which is pretty
popular for such an app.

## Functionality
Application is very simple, press the button to choose a book and read along.

    <div class="caption">Choose a book from the list and you're good to go</div>
</div>

In every summary you should find the book genre, motives, theme, plot time and
location, and of course the content summary. The nice thing about the app is
that all of the **content is baked into the app** itself so there is no need to
download anything additional. Once you have downloaded the app, the whole
content is offline and you can read without worrying about the internet
connection.
