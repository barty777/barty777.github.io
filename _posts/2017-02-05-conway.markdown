I have always thought that Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
was some perplexing game which
required a degree in rocket engineering to comprehend so one day I decided to
figure it all out. As it turned out, the game is actually trivial with
only four rules you have to follow:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation or exposure).
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.

I couldn't believe that such a simple game could yield such interesting results
so I opened PyCharm and got to work. A few hours a later I had a completely
functioning Game of Life. Although I haven't tried a lot of seeds, it was
interesting enough to watch the most basic ones evolve from a simple shape:

<div class="image">
    <img alt="1st iteration" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/conway/start.png" width="300">
    <div class="caption">Started from the bottom...</div>
</div>

to a moderately complex structure like this one:

<div class="image">
    <img alt="1st iteration" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/conway/stop.png" width="500">
    <div class="caption">... now we're here</div>
</div>

in just a few hundred of iterations.

One day maybe I will experiment with some more complex seeds, but this is not
this day. If you're also interested in experimenting, you can always download
the source code from [here](https://github.com/barty777/conways_game_of_life).
